Create an app for issues API of Github. 
The interface should be able to:
* Set up the repository
* Show the list of repository issues
* Filter tasks by assignee
* The filtering of issues should work with API, i. e. The solution to load all the issues and filter them on the client side is not allowed.
* Any other features can be added on your own.
* In addition, it needs to create a mechanism for displaying a loading indicator for every action and every component
